<b>Context</b>
</h1>

One of the most abundant particles in the universe is the neutrino. Although similar to an electron, nearly massless and electrically neutral neutrinos have fundamental properties that make them difficult to detect. However, to collect enough information to investigate the most violent astrophysical sources, scientists must estimate the direction of neutrino events. If the algorithms could be made considerably faster and more accurate, it would allow more neutrino events to be analyzed, possibly even in real time, and dramatically increase the chance of identifying cosmic neutrino sources. Rapid detection could allow networks of telescopes around the world to search for more transient phenomena.

Researchers have developed multiple approaches over the past ten years to reconstruct neutrino events. However, problems arise as existing solutions are far from perfect. They are fast but inaccurate or more accurate at the price of enormous computational costs.

By making the process faster and more accurate, it will help improve neutrino reconstruction. As a result, we all could get a clearer picture of our universe.

<b>Project Description</b>
</h1>

The objective of this project is to identify from which direction the neutrinos detected by the neutrino observatory come from. When detection events can be located quickly enough, traditional telescopes are used to investigate short-lived neutrino sources, such as supernovae or gamma-ray bursts. Because the sky is huge, better localization will not only associate neutrinos with sources, but also help partner observatories narrow their search space. With an average of three thousand events per second to process, it's hard to keep up with the flow of data using traditional methods. The intention is to quickly and accurately process a large number of events.

<b>Project Highlights</b>

* This project could help scientists better understand exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes, neutron stars and the fundamental properties of the neutrino itself. By making the process faster and more precise, it will help improve the reconstruction of neutrinos.
